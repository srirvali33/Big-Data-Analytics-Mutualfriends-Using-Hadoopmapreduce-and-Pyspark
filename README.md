# Big-Data-Analytics-Mutualfriends-Using-Hadoopmapreduce-and-Pyspark
A Bigdata project which analyzes social network data using "Hadoop mapreduce" and same with "Apache spark with python".
1> If two people are friend then they have a lot of mutual/common friends. This program will find the common/mutual friend list for them.
For example,
Alice’s friends are Bob, Sam, Sara, Nancy
Bob’s friends are Alice, Sam, Clara, Nancy
Sara’s friends are Alice, Sam, Clara, Nancy

As Alice and Bob are friend and so, their mutual friend list is [Sam, Nancy]
As Sara and Bob are not friend and so, their mutual friend list is empty. (This case is excluded from output).
